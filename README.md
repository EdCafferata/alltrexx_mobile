Open GPX Tracker is a GPS logger for iOS (iPhone, iPad, iPod) with offline map cache support. Track your location, add waypoints and send your logs by email as GPX files.

This app has no annoying time restrictions, no ads and no in-app-purchases. You can create unlimited GPX traces :).

If you are goint to track without Internet... don't worry! Before you go offline, browse the area where you'll be tracking and it will be cached and available offline.

We care about your privacy, all the data recorded using the application is kept in your phone (or in your iCloud), wherever you store it. The app does not share any GPS data with us or any other 3rd pary. For more information see the [Privacy Policy](https://github.com/merlos/iOS-Open-GPX-Tracker/wiki/Privacy-Policy)

Requires iOS 11.0 or above. Open GPX tracker is an open source app.

## Install

The app is [available on the App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/app/open-gpx-tracker/id984503772), available since May 2015.

Another option to install the app is to download the source code and compile it by yourself using [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) and the iOS simulator. If you want to run it on a iOS device, you also need an Apple developer account.

## Translate Open GPX Tracker
Open GPX tracker supports language translations (since 1.7.0). [See list of supported languages and how to translate the app into your language](https://github.com/merlos/iOS-Open-GPX-Tracker/wiki/How-to-translate-Open-GPX-Tracker-into-my-language).

## Development

This application is written in Swift. To download the code run this command in a console:

```
 git clone https://github.com/merlos/iOS-Open-GPX-Tracker.git
```

Then, to test it open the file `OpenGpxTracker.xcworkspace` with XCode.

Although the application uses some Cocoapods, all the pods are already included in our repo. So no need to run `pod install`.

Please note the [limitations of using Open Street Maps Tile Servers](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tile_usage_policy)

### Add a custom tile server
Adding a tile server is easy, just edit the file `GPXTileServer.swift`, uncomment the lines with `AnotherMap` and modify the templateUrl to point to the new tile server.

You have a list of tile servers in [Open Street Map Wiki](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tile_servers)

## Reference documentation

The application is being documented using [jazzy](https://github.com/realm/jazzy) and following [NSHipster tutorial on swift documentation](https://nshipster.com/swift-documentation/).

## Contribute

You can contribute by forking and submitting a pull request (PR).

Some conditions for a PR to be accepted:

1) Text displayed in the application shall be internationalized.
   - To do that use [NSLocalizedString](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nslocalizedstring). Search on the code to see examples of usage.
   - Add the keys of the localized string to all the `lproj` files. Keep this files organized in the same way (~ same line). 
   - Use [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com) or [DeepL](https://www.deepl.com/translator) to translate them to other languages. For example, for ChatGPT you can use a prompt similar to:
        ```
          You are a language translator that is in the process of translating an mobile application for getting GPX traces in an iOS device. 
          
          Please provide the translation to the following languages:
          German (de), Spanish (es), Chinese Simplified (zh-Hans), Ukranian (uk), Finnish (fi-FI), Russian (ru),French (fr), Dutch (nl), Portuguese Brazil (pt-BR), Italian (it) 

          of the following strings:

          "TEXT_KEY" = "This is the text";
          "TEXT_KEY" = "This is the text";
          ```


2) You need to install [swiftlint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint) and ensure you're not introducing additional lint warnings.

3) You need to document the classes and methods that you create explaining what do they do from a blackbox perspective. We use [jazzy](https://github.com/realm/jazzy) for the documentation. To install jazzy run:
    ```shell
    gem install jazzy
    ```
    Then, to view the documentation run 
    ```shell
    jazzy
    ```
    **Note that it will generate the documents in the `../gh-pages/docs`.**
